OVERVIEW
========

The project contains two modules:
    - decoder
    - player

The "decoder" module contains the Java and C code used for wrapping
the underlying AAC decoding algorithm (which is currently the OpenCORE aacdec,
but it could be easily changed).

The "player" module is an example how to use the "decoder" library in your
project.
